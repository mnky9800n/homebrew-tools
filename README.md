# ðŸªŸ Windowfied

Bring the superior power of Windows commands to your boring macOS terminal!

## What is Windowfied?

Windowfied is a Homebrew tap that provides Windows-style commands for macOS. Why struggle with cryptic Unix commands when you could use the intuitive Windows equivalents?

## Installation

```bash
brew install mnky9800n/tools/windowfied
```

## Commands

- `dir` - List directory contents with proper Windows-style formatting (because `ls` is for cavemen)

## Usage

```bash
# Instead of this archaic nonsense:
ls -la

# Use this civilized command:
dir
```

## Example Output

```
 Volume in drive disk3s1 is Macintosh HD - Data
 Directory of /Users/username/Documents
